# SarOS - Building an Operating System from Scratch

[Some Assembly required](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp5Z7utSI2IHQUsnkPH41bw) is a YouTube channel where we build from scratch an Operating System intended
to run on the [Orange Pi Zero 2](http://www.orangepi.org/Orange%20Pi%20Zero2/) with the [AllWinner H616](https://www.allwinnertech.com/index.php?c=product&a=index&id=89)
SoC.

This is an operating system for educational purposes only. It will not, and there is no intention for it to, become commercially or otherwise a fully functioning
general purpose OS.

The code is created as part of the channel, and the best way to follow along is to subscribe to the channel, the in sequence [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Hf0GvnDkk&list=PLGTIvEdBrUVlCJusWFJ6FI_nRE5xe74qF)
or the individual playlists breaking down specific tasks in the OS development life cycle (listed on the [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp5Z7utSI2IHQUsnkPH41bw/playlists)
tab of the channel).

Development here is going to be going a little slowly, as it is tied to the rate at which videos are being released, with a bi-weekly schedule.
